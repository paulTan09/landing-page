My take on The Odin Project's CSS Flexbox project. It's plain CSS + HTML, so that means no frameworks and no JS - hell, it doesn't even have event listeners tied to the buttons.
      I made this because I kind of ignored HTML and CSS while learning JavaScript, so I thought it'd be a good idea to start learning those 2 too. The project's still a bit janky, I would say (i.e some flex containers behave erratically when modifying the window aspect        ratio), but I think it's (mostly) good enough to push it. Besides, I do plan on fixing it (or building another bigger project with this one as a baseline).

   ######## Note related to the color scheme ########
   
 - I wanted to use the Solarized dark background color ( https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/ ) on the header and footer containers, which is #002B36. The images I have on the page also should've had a hex value of #002B36, but the value shifted to #002A35 for the images when viewing it from the browser. No idea why that happened, although I suspect it may have something to do with my monitor's ICC profile.
